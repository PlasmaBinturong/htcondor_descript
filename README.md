# htcondor_descript

Small tool to automatically generate the description file for the
`condor_submit` command.

I thought this would be useful for some users of
[htcondor](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/) on a computer cluster who
don't want to open a text file every time they need to run a job. Also this
will help automate the creation of description file for condor submission, for
example with pipeline managers like snakemake.
